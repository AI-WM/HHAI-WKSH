# Hyper-Heuristic A.I. Workshop

## What is Hyper-Heuristic?

It is not the hyper-heuristic algorithm in machine learning. We named this workshop “Hyper-Heuristic” because the main algorithm (random forests) we are going to learn, and use is “heuristic”.

## Who are we?

A group of people who are highly interested in A.I.

## What are we going to do?

Finished the course on fast.ai, understood how to interpret the meaning of every code, take notes and organized the notes together on GitHub.

## Why random forests?
1. Hyper-Heuristic
    
    Although you can typically find a model that beats random forests for any given dataset, it’s never by much, and it usually takes much longer to build. 

2. Fast

    Random Forests are very quick to train and can be easily grown in parallel.

3. Adaptable
    
    Random Forests are applicable to a wide variety of modeling tasks.
    
4. Visualization

    The algorithm is easy to visualize and present in daily use language.

## How would the event be?

- Before the event:

    Self-study and hand in notes via email

- In the event:

    Go through the lecture material, discuss the confusing part, collect notes and merge into one

- After the event: 
    
    We would organize and upload the notes to [GitHub](https://github.com/AI-WM/HHAI-WKSH)

## Which MOOC are we going to use?

[Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders!](https://course.fast.ai/ml.html) from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai)

## What is our schedule?

Event 1: Nov 4 & Nov 10 (same)

Event 2: Nov 21

Event 3: Dec 1

Event 4: Dec 15

Event 5: Dec 21 (virtual)

## What is the prerequisite?
   
1.	Able to spend around 2 ~ 4 hours for self-study (finish the video and take notes) before each event

2.	Python Programming Skills:

    - Know how to define variable and python data types (include string)
    
    - Know how to use list, tuple, dict, and set
    
    - Know if statement and loop
    
    - Know how to call and define a function
    
    - It is a plus to know Slice, Iteration, List Comprehensions, and Generator

3.	Finished [Lesson 1](https://course.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lesson1.html) individually before the event
